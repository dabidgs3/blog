Presentation Skills & Guidelines

Recently I have to prepare for my qualifying exam.
Qualifying exam at Berkeley is basically a presentation (two hours at maximum) during which you talk about your past project and your thesis plan.
While I've done some promising research project that the content should suffice, the particular way of presenting the materials  turns out to be more critical.
I've been through four iterations revising my slides; and every time, the feedback from my friends and colleagues is very enlightening.
Because there seems to be so many small, but very useful tips along the way, and I will definitely need to prepare for presentations in the future,
I'd like to write them down here as guidelines.

There are definitely alreay many guidelines on delivering a nice presentation; I will primarily focus on those rules that you can apply in your presentation.
By "apply", I mean you can almost run it like an algorithm to check if your presentation follows them.

### Every new word/concept is properly introduced and no synonyms (i.e. surprising words)

One mistake that I am making all the time is to use interchangeable words across the presentation.
At one place, I use "accuracy" and at a different place the word "utility" jumps out.
It may be fine for writings; it may be fine for leisure conversations.
But in a formal presentation, you should be precise about what you mean with any word, especially definitions and technical terms.

### Every figure has a proper legend

Check every rectangle, circle, curve, line or point on your figure. If things are not labelled, label them.
Don't assume that people will understand it with your verbal explanation:
some people may get distracted and then s/he won't get what you are talking about.

### Introduce concept with a `glance + refine` structure

To deliver a message with your presentation, you don't have to cover everything upfront.
Some people prefers to structure the presentation in a story-line mode: story opening, expanding, further investigation and concluding.
While it's a good structure, it does require the audience to pay full attention.
Depending on your audience, the full attention may be a luxury.
The easier way is to structure your presentation with a `glace + refine` structure:
you start with a tip of everything, and then progressively add details.

For people who feel not confident with the materials they are presenting (such as me), structuring the presentation with `glance + refine` is hard.
You want to impress the audience with glorious details to prove that you know what you are talking about, but that just confuses the audience.
Don't try too hard on proving something; simply layout the content with "what" (the glance) with "why and how" (the details).

### Minimize attack surface

This tip is only for people who are evaluated by the presentation, such as the qualifying exam I am about to attend.
You don't want to open up the attack surface by writing down too many arguments or omitting necessary details.
Although this rule is hard to check, one rule of thumb is the number of slides.
Having too many is a bad sign!

### Minimize transition because each slide transition is a context switching

You may be aiming for brevity and cleanness on the slides, don't push too hard.
It's easier to follow if there are some familiar contents on it.
Move from familiar materials to unfamiliar materials for transition.

### If a term appears for the second time, you have to explain it, otherwise the audience will confuse

You may get excused for the first time by saying: I will talk about it later. But for the second time, please give an explanation.

### Focus on clarity not sophistication

The goal of your presentation is not to impress the audience (though sometimes you do need to).
Don't feel bad if you include materials that seem obvious. Especiall some materials are only obvious to you.
Add enough explanation and examples so that the points or the arguments you made are clear.

The audience will have a pleasant experience if they understand everything; they will be confused with random points arguments.
