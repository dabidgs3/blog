## Week 1: Introduction to Design Your Life

#### Reading Materials

William Bridges: Transitions: Making Sense of Life's Changes, (Excerpt; pp. 36-39)


#### Assignment: Workview

Write your individual, personal Workview (150-200 words).  A "workview"
addresses the critical issues related to what work is and what it means to
you. It is not just a list of what you want from or out of work, but a general
statement of your view of work. A workview may address such questions as:

- Why work?
- What's work for?
- What's it mean?
- How does it relate to the individual, others, society?
- What defines good or worthwhile work?
- What does money have to do with it?
- What does experience, growth, fulfillment have to do with it?

#### Assignment: Worldview

Write a brief summary of your individual, personal worldview (150-200 words).
There are many approaches to worldviews and various prescriptions of what they
need to include.  Below are some questions which are classically addressed in a
worldview, though which are the important questions is a matter of choice. The
key thing is to address those highest order values and perspectives that provide
the ordering basis for your life, that create the platform that interprets and
organizes how you see and understand the world and assign order (or disorder) to
it. Your worldview is that which provides your definition of "matters of
ultimate concern."

You may wish to consider the following questions (and no - of course not
comprehensively):

- Why are we here?
- What is the meaning/purpose of life? of death?
- What is the relationship between the individual and others? Between persons
and the rest of life (and perhaps inanimate) and reality?
- What is good or worthwhile?
- What is the meaning of time, of eternity?
- Is there a higher power, transcendency, God and if so, of what nature and to
what import for your life?
- What of joy, sorrow, justice, injustice, love, peace, strife, good & evil?

## Week 2: Observe and Notice - Defining Perspectives

#### Reading Materials

- [Daniel Goleman: The Focused Leader (2013)](https://hbr.org/2013/12/the-focused-leader)
- [Emilie Wapnick: Why Some of Us Don't Have One True Calling? (2015)](https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling)

#### Assignment: Gratefulness Journal

For 5 days of the next week, spend 15 minutes tracking what you are grateful for
from that day. Please bring your gratitude journal to class on January 30th.

Write down up to five things for which you feel grateful. The physical record is
important—don't just do this exercise in your head. The things you list can be
relatively small in importance ("I had an amazing banh mi sandwich for lunch:)
or relatively large ("I passed my qualifying exam!"). The goal of the exercise
is to remember a good event, experience, person, or thing in your life—then
enjoy the good emotions that come with it.

Your gratitude journal can take whatever form you wish - there’s no wrong way to
do this. It can be drawn, sketched, represented with photographs and
captions. Enjoy the space to be creative or make it as easy for yourself as
possible - it's up to you.

Some tips:

1. Be as specific as possible—specificity is key to fostering gratitude. “I’m
   grateful that my co-workers brought me soup when I was sick on Tuesday”
   rather than “I’m grateful for my co-workers.”

2. Go for depth over breadth. Elaborating in detail about a particular person or
   thing for which you’re grateful carries more benefits than a superficial list
   of many things.

3. Get personal. Focusing on people to whom you are grateful has more of an
   impact than focusing on things for which you are grateful.
