Baking Bread
---

The title sounded quite like "Breaking Bad."

Baking bread is extremely rewarding, especially for someone who, like me, is
poor. With cheap ingredients and a bit of patience/time/planning, you get the
incredible combination of crispy outside and soft inside. I have started baking
my first loaf of bread since last October (2017) and enjoyed the moment when the
bread comes out of the oven. So satisfying. In the past, I have been mostly
following a simple recipe (using commercial yeast) and now it seems to be the
time to venture into more complex implementations.

I follow Ken Forkish's book ["Flour Water Salt Yeast" (FWSY)][fwsy]. It is an
awesome book, especially for anyone with an engineering mind. Ken worked for IBM
before he becomes a baker. The book is extremely easy to follow. The best part,
in comparison to other cooking books, is recommended schedules. Start mixing
flour and water at 9:30 AM and then fold at 10:30 AM, etc, etc, and you will get
the bread at 5 PM for dinner. Simply following the schedule ensures sufficient
time for the yeast to develop and the dough to rise. His insistence on using
weight rather than volumes really reflects the engineering mindset of being
precise.

This post is meant as a distillation of my own bread baking experience. It is
not meant to be informative. If you are interested, buy Ken's book.
