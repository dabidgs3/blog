### Compilers (with warnings) are your friends

Add proper flags to the compilation process to detect potential bugs, e.g.
treating all warnings as errors.

- `-Wall`
- `-Wextra`
- `-Wpedantic`
- `-Werror`
- `-Wshadow`
- `-Wstrict-overflow`
- `-fno-strict-aliasing`
- `-Wno-missing-field-initializers`

char *my_string = "Line 1 "
                  "Line 2";
```

## Trigraphs

```c
  // Will the next line be executed????????????????/
  a++;
```
