I am currently a PhD student at Berkeley, researching distributed systems.

I don't write a lot (though have tons of [tsukkomi](https://www.benzhang.name/moods/)).
Previous unsuccessful attempts include WordPress, Jekyll, Hugo and Medium...
The recurring pattern is that suddenly I get into the mood of writing something (like now),
explore a new platform because I am sick of the old ones (wanting a fresh start), and write
a few articles (promising myself I will keep writing) and then STOP.

This attempt may not be different, but still, worth trying, isn't it.
